# MNIST_experiment
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks.

# Goal:
Learn computer vision fundamentals with the famous MNIST data

## Pre-work in matlab:
* Followed Machine learning course from Andrew NG
* Completed exercise 4 (Neural Networks Learning on MNIST digit recognition)
* Code is not published according Coursera rules.

## Initial approach in python:
* Play with digit dataset from sklearn.
* Build model using multi layer Perceptron.
* Investigate efficiency of NN parameters.

## 2nd step in python:
* Use digit dataset from kaggle.
* Build model using multi layer Perceptron.
* Kaggle competition result : Your submission scored 0.93871.
